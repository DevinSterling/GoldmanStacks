Goldman Stacks is a proof of concept web-based online banking application written from the ground up using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. The application encompasses two user roles, which are client and employee. Clients can manage their funds by opening/closing bank accounts, and making deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and payments. Employees will be able to track client activity and be in charge of whether to approve client requests.
