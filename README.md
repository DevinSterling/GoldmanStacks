Goldman Stacks is a proof of concept web-based online banking application written from the ground up using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. The application encompasses two user roles, which are client and employee. Clients can manage their funds by opening/closing bank accounts, and making deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and payments. Employees will be able to track client activity and be in charge of whether to approve client requests. 

Website security consists of CSRF authentication tokens, inactivity detection, forced HTTPS, encryption, hashed passwords, front/back-end input validation, and prepared statements.
For end-user usability, the site consists of a responsive web design, redirects for 4xx and 5xx response codes, removal of file extension from URL, full-site bookmark compatibility, and lack of POST form-resubmission on refresh.
